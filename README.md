This project implements a visually engaging and interactive maze game using Python and Tkinter GUI. The project involved implementing a simplified DFS (Depth-first search) algorithm to calculate the shortest path between points, showcasing my practical problem-solving skills and algorithm application.
Features: 
Allowing the user to select the start and the end point.
Implements the Depth First Search algorithm to find a path from the start to the goal.
Visualizes the maze and the path using Tkinter GUI for user interface.
